Ousmane, a flash of brilliance on the field,
Your Ballon d'Or, a story to be revealed.
A tapestry of talent, woven with grace,
Speed and skill, leaving rivals in chase.

With every dribble, a symphony of art,
A dazzling display that captures the heart.
From Rennes to Dortmund, then Barcelona's call,
You conquered challenges, standing tall.

The golden orb, a testament so grand,
To years of dedication, a helping hand.
For in your journey, resilience takes flight,
A beacon of hope, shining ever so bright.

So raise the trophy, let the cheers resound,
Ousmane Dembele, a legend crowned.
Your name etched in history, forever to stay,
A Ballon d'Or winner, lighting up the way.
